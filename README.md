Hi, I'm Ameer Ikbal 👋

Systems-focused developer passionate about compilers, operating systems, and low-level game development.
I enjoy building software close to the hardware — from memory allocators to full compilation pipelines.

🚀 What I Work On

Compilers & Language Tooling
Building full compilation pipelines from lexical analysis to code generation.

Systems Programming (C/C++)
Memory management, stack-based architectures, virtual machines, and performance-oriented design.

🧠 Featured Projects

🔹 Jack Compiler (C++)

Modular compiler implementing tokenizer, recursive descent parser, and VM code generator.

🔹 VM Translator (C++)

Stack-based VM-to-Hack assembly translator modeling virtual machine architecture.

🔹 Jack OS

Custom operating system libraries including heap allocator, graphics engine, and standard library modules.

🔹 Space Fighter

Hardware-level arcade game with direct memory-mapped screen manipulation and custom collision logic.

🔹 Vstring (C)

Dynamic string library implementing safe resizing and manual memory management.
